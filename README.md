Capstone Project (Master's CE IS)
Within this Capstone environment I was assigned to the Blue Team and elected to hold the following positions:
- Penetration Testing Lead
- System Administration
- Assistant Team Lead
The objective of the above was to establish persistent access to the Red Team environment through the leveraging of discovered vulnerabilities following penetration methodlogies.
In addition, we were to deny persistent access from the Red Team.
Throughout the course of eight weeks, large strides were made in skills development relating to penetration testing, network defense, and system hardening as well as basic system administration tasks.
